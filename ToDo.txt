==WTF we need to do==
Steal Hydra's animation code (STOLEN, now to be implemented ;) )
Look for more stuff Elv broken after last update (as always lol)
Do something with switching between to Darth's from Repocc's settings. Everything continues to be so transparent o_O
So as pixel perfect is now default theme: optimize everything for this mode. (yeah yeah, a huge amount of work >_< wtb help)

==What we maybe can do==
Saw an idea about a dot tracker, saw some coding for it will look at it when have time...
Maybe add the ability to select amount of datatexts on each panel ranging from 1-3 slots

==Testing Github Branches==
--PTR Branch
